## Javascript Example With CORS

This is a simple call to the Ungerboeck API that shows you how to use Javascript with AJAX.  It also gives an example on how CORS works within an API call.

To enable CORS within your environment, please contact our [Cloud IT Support](https://supportcenter.ungerboeck.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and include any possible domains that will hit your Momentus Enterprise server domain.
